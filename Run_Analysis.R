# R script namely run_analysis.R that does the following:

# i) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# ii) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# iii) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# iv) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
# v) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
